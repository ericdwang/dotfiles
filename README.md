# Dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles, serving mainly as a way for me to keep them clean
and document what everything does before I forget.

These files are intended to be used on a GNU/Linux operating system; no idea
if they'll work on OS X or with BusyBox.

## Installation
Just run the `install.sh` script from any directory. It'll create symbolic
links for all the dotfiles if they don't exist. Some dotfiles also require
external files, which will be downloaded if they don't exist.
